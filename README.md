# EEG Training Materials

A very simple experiment script for an auditory-oddball paradigm is found in the `experiment` folder. This script has a test mode for timing tests; a tutorial for computing timing test results (and some scattered tips on acheiving good timing) lives in a Jupyter notebook in the `timing-test` folder.
